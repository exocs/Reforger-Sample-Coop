# Sample Coop Addon
This addon is a very early and simple overlook of setting up a coop-based addon for Arma Reforger.
![Preview Image](https://github.com/exocs/Reforger-Sample-Coop/blob/main/PreviewImage.jpg?raw=true)

## Content
- Simple test world *(with mission header)*
- Basic prefab setup *(with proper inheritance)*
- AI groups spawning *(static and dynamic)*
- AI waypoints *(static and dynamic)*
- Simple win condition *(a rather naïve one*)

## Running the addon
- Clone the repo somewhere on your storage
- Start the Enfusion Workbench
- Click on add existing
- Navigate the browser to Reforger-Sample-Coop/SampleCoop/addon.gproj
- Select Sample Coop and click Open

## Disclaimer
The solution inside is far from perfect, it should rather serve as an initial example of how to set up game modes to allow for other game modes than Conflict and Capture & Hold and should give you some insight in how you can approach some of the challenges.

If you encounter any problems, please let me know on the [Arma discord](http://discord.gg/arma).
